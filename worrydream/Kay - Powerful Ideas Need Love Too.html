<h1>Powerful Ideas Need Love Too!</h2>

<p><i>Written remarks to a Joint Hearing of the
Science Committee and the Economic and Educational and Opportunites
Committee</i></p>

<p><b>October 12, 1995</b></p>

<p>Let me start the conversation by showing
a video made by the National Science Foundation at a recent Harvard
commencement, in which they asked some of the graduating seniors
and their professors a few simple questions about what causes
the seasons and the phases of the moon. All were confident about
their answers, but roughly 95% gave explanations that were not
even close to what science has discovered. Their main theories
were that the seasons are caused by the Earth being closer to
the sun in summer, and that the phases of the moon are caused
by the Earth's shadow. Some of the graduates had taken quite a
bit of science in high school and at Harvard. NSF used this to
open a discussion about why science isn't learned well even after
years of schooling. And not learned well even by most of the successful
students, with high SATs, at the best universities, with complete
access to computers, networks, and information.</p>

<p>My reaction was a little different. I kept
waiting for the &quot;other questions&quot; that NSF should have
asked, but they never did. I got my chance a few weeks later after
giving a talk at UCLA. I asked some of the seniors, first year
graduate students, and a few professors the same questions about
the seasons and the phases of the moon and got very similar results:
about 95% gave bogus explanations along the same lines as the
Harvard students and professors. But now I got to ask the next
questions.</p>

<p>To those that didn't understand the seasons,
I asked if they knew what season it was in South America and Australia
when it is summer in North America. They all knew it was winter.
To those that didn't understand the phases of the moon, I asked
if they had ever seen the moon and the sun in the sky at the same
time. They all had. Slowly, and only in a few, I watched them
struggle to realize that having opposite seasons in the different
hemispheres could not possibly be compatible with their &quot;closer
to the sun for summer&quot; theory, and that the sun and the moon
in the sky together could not possibly be compatible with their
&quot;Earth blocks the suns rays&quot; theory of the phases.</p>

<p>To me NSF quite missed the point. They thought
they were turning up a &quot;science problem,&quot; but there
are thousands of science &quot;facts&quot; and no scientist knows
them all; we should be grateful that the Harvard and UCLA students
didn't &quot;know the answers.&quot; What actually turned up is
a kind of &quot;math problem,&quot; a thinking and learning problem
that is far more serious.</p>

<p>Why more serious? Because the UCLA students
and professors (and their Harvard counterparts) knew something
that contradicted the very theories they were trying to articulate
and not one of them could get to that contradictory knowledge
to say, &quot;Hey, wait a minute...&quot;! In some form, they
&quot;knew&quot; about the opposite seasons and that they had
seen the sun and the moon in the sky at the same time, but they
did not &quot;know&quot; in any operational sense of being able
to pull it out of their memories when thinking about related topics.
Their &quot;knowings&quot; were isolated instead of set up to
be colliding steadily with new ideas as they were formed and considered.</p>

<p>What was going on with them--and what similarly
goes on with children every day in school? To understand this,
we have to find out how we humans are &quot;naturally&quot; set
up to think and learn.</p>

<p>We can get a clue from the Bible. King Solomon
was held to be the wisest man who ever lived and it says why:
he knew more than 3000 proverbs! And proverbs work as follows:
if you come home from a trip and your family is glad to see you,
then &quot;Absence made their hearts grow fonder.&quot; But if
you come home from a trip and they aren't particularly glad to
see you then the reason is...what? That's right, &quot;Out of
sight, out of mind.&quot; Each proverb exists to give meaning
to a particular situation, and each is recalled on a case to case
basis. If the proverb you use today (or the play or movie you
see today) contradicts the one from last week, it is of no moment
because proverbs and stories are evaluated mainly on how good
they are right now, not how they compare to the other proverbs
and stories in the pool.</p>

<p>This way of thinking and giving meaning
to one's life and society in terms of stories and narratives is
universal over all cultures, and is in our basic &quot;wiring&quot;
as human beings. It is part of what we call &quot;common sense.&quot;
And it is the way most of the college students that NSF and I
talked to had &quot;learned science&quot;--as isolated cases,
stories that would be retrieved to deal with a similar situation,
not as a system of inter related arguments about what we think
we know and how well we think we know it. Story thinking won out.
Claude Levi-Strauss and Seymour Papert have called this incremental
isolated &quot;natural&quot; learning &quot;bricolage&quot;--which
means making something by &quot;tinkering around.&quot; This is
one of the reasons that engineering predates science by thousands
of years; some constructions can be accomplished gradually by
trial and error without needing any grand explanations for why
things work.</p>

<p>Yet if we look back over the last 400 years
to ponder what ideas have caused the greatest changes in human
society and have ushered in our modern era of democracy, science,
technology and health care, it should be a bit of a shock to realize
that none of these is in story form! Newton's treatise on the
laws of motion, the force of gravity, and the behavior of the
planets is set up as a sequence of arguments that imitate Euclid's
books on geometry. All scientific papers since then are likewise
given as special kinds of arguments, not stories. Tom Paine's
Common Sense is a forty page argument about why monarchies are
not a good form of government and why a democracy is likely to
be better. (This was not actually &quot;common sense,&quot; but
&quot;uncommon sense&quot; since historically, the movement to
democracy is incredibly rare.) The Federalist Papers are arguments
that support different parts of the design of the Constitution.
And the Constitution itself is a set of principles for building
a very complex dynamic structure that should last for centuries
whose &quot;parts&quot; (that is, us!) come and go and are only
somewhat intercooperative. It is most definitely not a story!</p>

<p>Recent studies have shown that less than
5% of American adults (less than 7% in the UK) have learned to
think fluently in these modern nonstory forms. A recent perusal
of the top 150 selling books in the US (as of Sept 15th, thanks
to www.usatoday.com) shows that 80% are in story form, 15% are
self help books, 1.5% could be construed to have some scientific
content, and none were in the form of serious argumentative essays
(occasionally there appears an extended essay such as Bloom's
The Closing of the American Mind, but none in the top 150 in Sept.).
And these are percentages for the smallish number of Americans
that buy books at all--remember that a bestseller is around 100,000
books, and a &quot;run-away bestseller&quot; is usually no more
than 1,000,000 books in a nation of some 250 millions! Television,
of course, is all about stories, and finds any other form almost
impossible to deal with. Note, for example, how PBS deals with
&quot;serious subjects&quot;--they are still given as stories,
and at their very best, they function as ads for books that actually
hold the real content.</p>

<p>Now my point here is not to urge that stories
be given up. I love to hear and read them, and I love to see them
enacted in the theater. If we couldn't think &quot;story&quot;
in the theater, all we would see are actors in front of cardboard
scenery supported by various noises from instruments in the pit.
To enjoy theater, we have to give ourselves over to the narrative,
experience actors as ourselves, the symbolic scenery as a place
and mood, and the noises from the pit as stirring music. It works
wonderfully well and we can participate deeply in what it means
to be human via this process. But now consider going to a similar
building, with similar people on a stage uttering similar glorious
sentences, all supported by symbolic scenery and stirring music.
Sound like theater? But here I am refering to a political rally.</p>

<p>What we are so willing to surrender in theater,
we had better hold on to with both hands here! Since our whole
meaning of life and relationships with others require us to invest
symbols with meaning and to give up part of ourselves to ideas,
we have to get pretty sophisticated to work both sides of the
street: to be tender-minded when our souls can be lifted, and
be tough-minded when someone is trying to take them away from
us. I believe that the main goal of learning is to learn that
discernment, to learn how to make symbols work for us.</p>

<p>But just being able to criticize the kind
of story in which one is embedded is not nearly enough, given
that so much of important modern content, both politically and
scientifically, is rendered in forms other than stories. In order
to be completely enfranchised in the 21st century, it will be
very important for children to get fluent in the three central
forms of thinking that are now in use: &quot;stories,&quot; &quot;logical
arguments,&quot; and &quot;systems dynamics.&quot; The question
is &quot;how?&quot;</p>

<p>One of the arguments advanced for why it
is so difficult to get most children to learn to think in these
new ways is that &quot;this kind of thinking is hard to learn.&quot;
But it is quite hard to learn to ride a bike, harder still to
shoot baskets, and one of the hardest things to learn how to do
is to hit a baseball consistently. If one watches children trying
to learn these skills, what one sees is that they fail most of
the time, but keep on trying until they learn, usually over years.
This is more like their attitude when learning to walk and talk
than the defeatism so often found in schoolwork. In fact, what
really seems to be the case is that children are willing to go
to any lengths to learn very difficult things and endure almost
an endless succession of &quot;failures&quot; in the process if
they have a sense that the activity is an integral part of their
culture.</p>

<p>Montesorri used this very successfully in
her schools. Suzuki has had similar success in music learning
via setting up a musical culture in which the child is embedded.
Television and cultural continuity is very good at providing an
environment that includes athletics and certain kinds of music
and dance, and shows what it means to be highly skilled at them.
An impressively large number of scientists either had a scientist
parent or one who was extremely interested in science--sometimes
just extremely interested in &quot;learning as a high calling.&quot;
Difficulty is not the real issue here. Belonging to a culture
and building a personal identity are. We could call this &quot;rite
of passage&quot; motivation.</p>

<p>If we hark back to the less than 5% estimates
for the percentage of the American population that has learned
to think in these new ways and recall that television is not a
good medium to show these new ways of thinking, this means that
most children will have no embedded cultural experience in these
ideas before coming to school. I don't know what percentage of
elementary school teachers have learned to think in these new
ways, but I would guess from personal experience that it is very
similar to that of the population as a whole. This means that
it will be very unlikely for most children to experience these
new ways of thinking at home or at school or through television--especially
as embedded into the general ways of doing and thinking which
are so important to how children assign value to what they are
going to try really hard to learn.</p>

<p>Now something that is very hard to do, and
which is not seen by a child as an important &quot;rite of passage,&quot;
is simply not going to be focused on with the intensity, stick-to-it-ness
and tolerance of failure that is required to get over the hurdles.
One of the great problems with the way most schools are set up
is that the children quickly sense that most of the stuff they
are asked to do is not &quot;real,&quot; especially as opposed
to optional activities like sports and games, art and music. They
know these are &quot;real,&quot; and a school has to go to great
lengths to make them artificial enough for the children to lose
interest.</p>

<p>Let me give an analogy to how the &quot;setting
up an environment&quot; strategy might be dealt with--it is drawn
from a learning experience I had as a child.</p>

<p>Suppose it were music that the nation is
concerned about. Our parents are worried that their children won't
succeed in life unless they are musicians. Our musical test scores
are the lowest in the world. After much hue and cry, Congress
comes up with a technological solution: &quot;by the year 2000
we will put a piano in every classroom! But there are no funds
to hire musicians, so we will retrain the existing teachers for
two weeks every summer. That should solve the problem!&quot; But
we know that nothing much will happen here, because as any musician
will tell you, the music is not in the piano--if it were we would
have to let it vote! What music there is, is inside each and every
one of us.</p>

<p>Now some things will happen with a piano
in every classroom. The children will love to play around with
it, and a &quot;chopstick culture&quot; is likely to develop.
This is &quot;piano by bricolage&quot;. Some will be encouraged by parents
to take lessons, and a few rare children will decide to take matters
into their own hands and find ways to learn the real thing without
any official support. Other kinds of technologies, such as recordings,
support the notion of &quot;music appreciation.&quot; It seems
to turn most away from listening, but a few exceptions may be
drawn closer. The problem is that &quot;music appreciation&quot;
is like the &quot;appreciation&quot; of &quot;science&quot; or
&quot;math&quot; or &quot;computers,&quot; it isn't the same as
actually learning music, science, math, or computing!</p>

<p>But 50 years ago, I had the experience of
growing up in a community that desired &quot;real music for all,&quot;
and found a way to make it work. It was a little town in New England
that only had 200 students in the high school, yet had a tradition
of having a full band, orchestra and chorus. This required that
almost every child become a fluent musician. The secret is that
every child starts off as a musician in their heart and each has
a voice to sing with. They taught us to sing all the intervals
and sight-read single parts in first grade. In second grade we
sang two parts. In third grade we sang four parts and started
to chose instruments. Talent was not a factor, though of course
it did show up. This was something everyone did, and everyone
enjoyed. I did not find out that this was unusual until I moved
away. An important sidelight is that there was a piano in every
classroom and all the teachers could play a little, though I am
sure that at least one of the teachers was not very musical. What
seemed to make it work was that the community had an excellent
musical specialist for the elementary grades who visited each
classroom several times a week. I remember that one teacher didn't
like my phrasing in a song and tried to change it, but the specialist
did like it and encouraged me to see if I could phrase the rest
of the song that way.</p>

<p>The central point to this story is not so
much that most of the children became fluent musicians by the
time they got to high school--they did and had done so for generations--but
that as far as I can tell, almost all still love and make music
as adults (including me).</p>

<p>We can find this &quot;create an embedded
environment and support classroom teachers with visiting experts&quot;
strategy in a number of schools today. The Open Charter School
of Los Angeles has succeeded in setting up a &quot;design culture&quot;
in their third grade classrooms that embeds the children in a
year-long exciting and difficult adventure in the large-scale
design of cities. The most successful elementary school science
program I know of is in all of the Pasadena elementary schools
and is organized along the same lines. It was developed by Jim
Bowers and Jerry Pines, two Caltech scientists, and the key is
not just an excellent set of curriculum ideas and approaches,
but that the classroom teachers have to gain some real fluency,
and there is important scaffolding and quality control by expert
circuit riders from the district.</p>

<p>To say it again, children start off loving
to learn, and most can learn anything the culture throws at them.
But they are best at learning ideas that seem to be an integral
part of the surrounding culture. Having a parent or teacher that
encourages them to study math and science is not even close to
having one that lives math and science (or seems to). This is
the strongest pedagogical strategy I have encountered over more
than 25 years of working with children. Technologies--such as
books, musical instruments, pen and paper, bats and balls--can
help, but they are clearly not enough to get kids over the critical
hurdles all by themselves. On the other hand, literacy, music,
art, dance, and sports can all flourish with little or no supporting
technologies at all--supporting adults are all that are needed.</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb for curriculum design
is to aim at being idea based, not media based. Every good teacher
has found this out. Media can sometimes support the learning of
ideas, but often the best solutions are found by thinking about
how the ideas could be taught with no supporting media at all.
Using what children know, can do, and are often works best. After
some good approaches have been found, then there might be some
helpful media ideas as well.</p>

<p>Now let me turn to the dazzling new technologies
of computers and networks for a moment. Perhaps the saddest occasion
for me is to be taken to a computerized classroom and be shown
children joyfully using computers. They are happy, the teachers
and administrators are happy, and their parents are happy. Yet,
in most such classrooms, on closer examination I can see that
the children are doing nothing interesting or growth inducing
at all! This is technology as a kind of junk food--people love
it but there is no nutrition to speak of. At its worst, it is
a kind of &quot;cargo cult&quot; in which it is thought that the
mere presence of computers will somehow bring learning back to
the classroom. Here, any use of computers at all is a symbol of
upward mobility in the 21st century. With this new kind of &quot;piano,&quot;
what is missing in most classrooms and homes is any real sense
of whether music is happening or just &quot;chopsticks.&quot;</p>

<p>I have found that there are many analogies
to books and the history of the printing press that help when
trying to understand the computer. Like books, the computer's
ability to represent arbitrary symbols means that its scope is
the full range of human endeavors that can be expressed in languages.
This range extends from the most trivial--such as astrology, comic
books, romance novels, pornography--to the most profound--such
as political, artistic and scientific discussion. The computer
also brings something very new to the party, and that is the ability
to read and write its own symbols, and to do so with blazing speed.
The result is that the computer can also represent dynamic situations,
again with the same range: from &quot;Saturday Morning cartoons,&quot;
to games and sports, to movies and theater, to simulations of
complex social and scientific theories.</p>

<p>The analogy to a library of books and communication
systems is found in the dynamic networking of millions of computers
together in the Internet. Newly added are that one can use this
new kind of library from anywhere on earth, it is continuously
updated, and users can correspond and even work together on projects
without having to be in the same physical location.</p>

<p>To us, working on these ideas thirty years
ago, it felt as though the next great &quot;500 year invention&quot;
after the printing press was being born. And for a few percent--very
like the few that used the book to learn, understand, and debate
powerful ideas and usher in new ways of thinking about the world--computers
and networks are starting to be that important. The computer really
is the next great thing after the book. But also as with the book,
most are being left behind.</p>

<p>Here is where the analogy to books vs. television
is most sobering. In America, printing has failed as a carrier
of important ideas for most Americans. Few get fluent enough in
reading to follow and participate in the powerful ideas of our
world. Many are functionally illiterate, and most who do some
reading, read for entertainment at home and for information on
the job (viz the 95% of bestsellers as stories and self-help).
Putting the Federalist Papers on the Internet will eventually
provide free access to all, but to have this great collection
of arguments be slightly more accessable in the 21st century than
it is today in public libraries will make no change in how many
decide to read its difficult but worthwhile prose. Once again
we are face to face with something that &quot;is hard to learn,&quot;
but has lost its perceived value to Americans--they ask why should
they make the effort to get fluent in reading and understanding
such deep content?</p>

<p>Television has become America's mass medium,
and it is a very poor container for powerful ideas. Television
is the greatest &quot;teaching machine&quot; ever created. Unfortunately,
what it is best at teaching are not the most important things
that need to be learned. And it is so bad at teaching these most
important ideas that it convinces most viewers that they don't
even exist!</p>

<p>Now computers can be television-like, book-like,
and &quot;like themselves.&quot; Today's commercial trends in
educational and home markets are to make them as television-like
as possible. And the weight of the billions of dollars behind
these efforts is likely to be overwhelming. It is sobering to
realize that in 1600, 150 years after the invention of the printing
press, the top two bestsellers in the British Isles were the Bible
and astrology books! Scientific and political ways of thinking
were just starting to be invented. The real revolutions take a
very long time to appear, because as McLuhan noted, the intial
content and values in a new medium is always taken from old media.</p>

<p>Now one thing that is possible with computers
and networks, that could get around some of the onslaught of &quot;infobabble,&quot;
is the possibility of making media on the Internet that is &quot;self
teaching.&quot; Imagine a child or adult just poking around the
Internet for fun and finding something--perhaps about rockets
or gene splicing--that looks intriguing. If it were like an article
in an encyclopedia, it would have to rely on expository writing
(at a level chosen when the author wrote it) to convey the ideas.
This will wind up being a miss for most netsurfers, especially
given the general low level of reading fluency today. The computer
version of this will be able to find out how old and how sophisticated
is the surfer and instantly tailor a progression of learning experiences
that will have a much higher chance of introducing each user to
the &quot;good stuff&quot; that underlies most human knowledge.
A very young child would be given different experiences than older
ones--and some of the experiences would try to teach the child
to read and reason better as a byproduct of their interest. This
is a &quot;Montesorri&quot; approach to how some media might be
organized on the Internet: one's own interests provide the motivation
to journey through an environment that is full of learning opportunities
disguised as toys.</p>

<p>This new kind of &quot;dynamic media&quot;
is possible to make today, but very hard and expensive. Yet it
is the kind of investment that a whole country should be able
to understand and make. I still don't think it is a real substitute
for growing up in a culture that loves learning and thinking.
But in such a culture, such new media would allow everyone to
go much deeper, in more directions, and experience more ways to
think about the world than is possible with the best books today.
Without such a culture, such media is likely to be absolutely
necessary to stave off the fast approaching next Dark Ages.</p>

<p>Schools are very likely the last line of
defence in the global trivialization of knowledge--yet it appears
that they have not yet learned enough about the new technologies
and media to make the important distinctions between formal but
meaningless activities with computers and networks and the fluencies
needed for real 21st century thinking. At their best, schools
are research centers for finding out interesting things, and like
great research centers, these findings are best done with colleagues.
There will always be a reason to have such learning centers, but
the biggest problem is that most schools today are not even close
to being the kinds of learning centers needed for the 21st century.</p>

<p>Will Rogers once said that its not what
you don't know that really hurts you, but what you think you know!
The best ploy here--for computing, science, math, literature,
the arts, and music--is for schools to be quite clear that they
don't know--they are the blind people trying to figure out the
elephant--and then try to find strategies that will help gradually
reveal the elephant. This is what the top professionals in their
fields do. We find Rudolph Serkin in tears at age 75 accepting
the Beethoven medal, saying &quot;I don't deserve this&quot; and
meaning it. We find Nobel physicist Richard Feynmann telling undergraduates
in his physics course at Caltech just how much he doesn't understand
about physics, especially in his specialty! We can't learn to
see until we realize we are blind.</p>

<p>The reason is that understanding--like civilization,
happiness, music, science and a host of other great endeavors--is
not a state of being, but a manner of traveling. And the main
goal of helping children learn is to find ways to show them that
great road which has no final destination, and that manner of
traveling in which the journey itself is the reward.</p>
